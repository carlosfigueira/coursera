  If by stating that if φ is valid then the conjunction (ψ ∧ θ) is valid, then
  by the definition of the conjunction, we can conclude that if φ is valid then
  ψ is valid (weakening the conjunction) and if φ is valid then θ is valid.

  Definition of odd(x): There is a number x' >= 0 such as 2*x' + 1 = x
  First side (m and n are odd, m*n is odd):
    m = 2*m' + 1 (definition of odd numbers)
    n = 2*n' + 1 (definition of odd numbers)
    m * n = (2*m' + 1) * (2*n' + 1) = 4*m'*n' + 2*m' + 2*n' + 1 = 2*(2*m'*n' + m' + n') + 1 => is odd (definition of odd numbers)
  
  Second part (either m or n is not odd, m*n is not odd)
    Assuming m is odd (proof is the same for the case of n)
    m = 2*m'
    m*n = 2*m'*n = 2*(m'*n) => not odd

  No: counter-example: m=4, n=3. Not true that m and n are even, but it is true that m*n is even
