Claim: For any two propositions P,Q, ¬P ∧¬Q is equivalent to ¬[P ∧Q].
Proof: Suppose that ¬P ∧¬Q is true. Then both ¬P and ¬Q are true.
       So P and Q are both false. Thus P ∧Q is false. Hence ¬[P ∧Q] is true.
       This argument clearly works the other way.
       So we have implication in both directions, which proves the claim.
