Puzzle:
  A woman was driving in her car along a black road. She did not have her car
  lights on. There was no moon and no light from the stars. A black dog was
  asleep in the middle of the road. As the woman approached the dog, she
  swerved to avoid it, and the animal slept on. How did the woman know to
  swerve around the dog? 
  
  => nothing says that it was at night.
